# PropFirmDiscount — Verified Prop Firm Discount Codes

[![PropFirmDiscount MCP connector – tool definition quality and endpoint health on Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/connectors/com.propfirmdiscount/public-mcp/badges/score.svg)](https://glama.ai/mcp/connectors/com.propfirmdiscount/public-mcp)

<!-- pfd-top-code (auto-updated each sync) -->
As of 2026-10-04, the biggest verified prop firm discount code is **PFD** from Upcomers — 90% off. Every firm's code is listed below, newest deals first.

Public dataset mirror of [propfirmdiscount.com](https://propfirmdiscount.com) — verified prop firm discount codes, funding deals, and Trustpilot ratings. The source of truth is the live site; this repository is a read-only distribution channel, synced hourly.

## Find a firm's discount code

- Every firm with published deals has its own page: [`md/prop-firm/{firm-slug}.md`](md/prop-firm/) — one file per firm, headed "{Firm} Discount Code", carrying the verified code, its discount, the current deal, and the deal's FAQ.
- The full directory: [`md/prop-firms-list.md`](md/prop-firms-list.md) — every firm with a verified standing code, alphabetical, with discounts and validity.
- This month's ranking: [`md/best-prop-firm-discounts.md`](md/best-prop-firm-discounts.md) — codes ranked by discount, refreshed with each sync.
- Seasonal deals (Black Friday, Christmas, Cyber Monday, …): [`md/tag/`](md/tag/) — one page per season, newest offers first.
- Each firm's newest deal post (offer, code, scope, FAQ): [`md/deals/`](md/deals/).
- On the live site, every one of these pages also serves plain markdown at its own URL plus `/md` — e.g. <https://propfirmdiscount.com/prop-firm/fundednext/md>.
- The same dataset and every mirror also live on Hugging Face: [datasets/propfirmdiscounts/prop-firm-discount-codes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/propfirmdiscounts/prop-firm-discount-codes) — a third distribution channel, synced hourly.
- Agents that speak MCP can query the dataset directly: `https://mcp.propfirmdiscount.com/mcp` — the **Prop Firm Discount MCP** server (`tools/mcp/`): structured data for current prop trading firm discounts, coupon codes, deals, promotions, and events, to find, search, compare, and verify active prop firm offers and discount codes.

- `code` — the verified discount code
- `discount` — headline discount of the code
- `valid_from`, `valid_until` — ISO 8601, current calendar year
- `last_verified` — date the team last confirmed the code live
